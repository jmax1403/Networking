ssh net1_student1@10.50.30.255 -D 9050 -NT
    set up dynamic port forward to pivot from IH

ssh net1_student1@10.50.30.255 -L 10100:10.1.1.11:23 -NT
    lpf to device past the pivot on telnet


tcpdump -r capstone-bpf.pcap "ip[1]>>2 = 26 && dst host 10.0.0.103" | wc -l

ip[6] & 0x20 = 0x20 || ip[6:2] & 0x01fff > 0
    Look for fragmented packets
    
Dynamic
    ssh -D <port> -p <alt port> <user>@<pivot ip> -NT







Net recon methodology
    1.Host Discovery(nmap,scan.sh, nc, ping sweep)
    2.Port Discovery (nmap, scan.sh, nc)
    3.Port Validation (aka banner grabbing - nc)
    4.Follow on actions(based on ports)
        a.if port is 21 or 80 wget -r IP or wget -r ftp://IP
        b.if port is 22 or 23: connect and do passive recon
Scan methodology
    1.Quick Scan port 21-23 80
    2.Specific Ports based on hints/clues found
    3.Well known port range 1-1024
    4.Chunks of 2000 or first 10000
    5.Hail Mary 1-65335
Passive recon methodology
    1.hostname
    2.Interfaces and subnets? ip a, ip neigh
    3.Neighbors? arp -a, ip neigh
    4.Files of Interest (pcaps, flags, etc): find
    5. Other ports are listening? ss -nltp
    6.Available tools? which tcpdump wireshark nmap wget curl
        a.We may also have to sniff for additional creds in the clear if hinted to do so
