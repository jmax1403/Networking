Capture Libraries
    Libpcap
    Winpcap
    NPCAP
"ip a" = command to show interfaces on your box

Wireshark
    Convenient, Easy to read
    Not efficient for large pcaps
TCPDUMP
    Command line oriented
    more efficient for large captures
    curl cht.sh/tcpdump
    when running tcpdump on an interface on yor box requires sudo
    e.g.
        sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -XXvv -w some.pcap
            #"-w" = writes to file some.pcap
                can open pcap in wireshark as well
            #"-r" = reads from that file
BPF
    tcpdump {A} [B:C] {D} {E} {F} {G}

    A = Protocol (ether | arp | ip | ip6 | icmp | tcp | udp)
    B = Header Byte offset
    C = optional: Byte Length. Can be 1, 2 or 4 (default 1)
    D = optional: Bitwise mask (&)
    E = Operator (= | == | > | < | <= | >= | != | () | << | >>)
    F = Result of Expresion
    G = optional: Logical Operator (&& ||) to bridge expressions
    
    E.G.
        tcpdump 'ether[12:2] = 0x0800 && (tcp[2:2] != 22 && tcp[2:2] != 23)'
